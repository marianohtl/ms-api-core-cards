# Flashcard Service Specification

## 1. Overview

The **Flashcard Service** is responsible for managing collections, decks, and cards within the study platform.

This service operates within a microservices architecture and is consumed by multiple BFFs (Deck and Review) via HTTP/JSON. It persists data in a relational database and follows a hierarchical domain model:

**Collection → Deck → Card**

This repository focuses exclusively on this service.

---

## 2. Responsibilities

- Create, update, delete, and retrieve:
    - Collections
    - Decks
    - Cards
- Provide structured data for frontend consumption via BFFs
- Maintain relational integrity between entities
- Persist and retrieve data from the database

---

## 3. Non-Responsibilities

- Authentication and authorization (Auth Service)
- User profile management (User Service)
- Frontend orchestration (BFF layer)
- Review logic (handled by Review MFE/BFF)
- Notifications or analytics

---

## 4. Architecture Context

The Flashcard Service is consumed by:

- Deck BFF (management flows)
- Review BFF (study flows)

Communication is synchronous via HTTP/JSON.

```
[MFE Deck / Review]
        |
        v
      [BFF]
        |
        v
[Flashcard Service] ---> [Relational Database]
```

---

## 6. Data Model

### 6.1 Domain Structure

- A **Collection** contains multiple **Decks**
- A **Deck** contains multiple **Cards**

---

### 6.2 Relational Tables

### collections

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| name | STRING | Collection name |
| user_id | UUID | Owner reference |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp |

---

### decks

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| name | STRING | Deck name |
| collection_id | UUID | FK → collections.id |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp |

---

### cards

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| front | TEXT | Card front content |
| back | TEXT | Card back content |
| deck_id | UUID | FK → decks.id |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMP | Last update timestamp |

---

### 6.3 Relationships

- `decks.collection_id` → `collections.id`
- `cards.deck_id` → `decks.id`

---

### 6.4 JSON Representation (Aggregated View)

```json
{
  "collectionId": "uuid",
  "collectionName": "string",
  "decks": [
    {
      "deckId": "uuid",
      "deckName": "string",
      "cards": [
        {
          "cardId": "uuid",
          "cardFront": "string",
          "cardBack": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 7. Data Integrity Rules

- A deck must always belong to a collection
- A card must always belong to a deck
- Deleting a collection should cascade delete decks and cards
- Deleting a deck should cascade delete cards

---

## 8. Error Handling

Standard format:

```json
{
  "code": "FLASHCARD_001",
  "message": "Resource not found"
}
```

### Common Errors

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| FLASHCARD_001 | Resource not found |
| FLASHCARD_002 | Invalid request data |
| FLASHCARD_003 | Relationship constraint fail |

---

## 9. Observability

- Logs: Structured JSON

---

## 10. Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.0
- Maven
- Relational Database (H2 Database will be used for local development and demonstrations)

---

## 11. Package Structure

Base package:

```
com.mindlessducks.coreflashcard
```

Suggested modules:

- controllers
- services
- repositories
- entities
- dto
- config

---

## 12. Versioning

- Versioned endpoints recommended (`/v1`)
- Backward compatibility required for public APIs
